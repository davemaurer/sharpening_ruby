# So we can define a variable that holds two string values, inside of an array.
two_strings = ['String one is at index 0', 'String two is at index 1']

# And now if we want to access 'string_one' we can use the array's index:
two_strings[0] # => "String one is at index 0"
# Aaaannnnnd for the second value?
two_strings[1] # => "String two is at index 1"

# So. In the above examples, we store ONE object, an array, which itself contains multiple values. Those values are also
# objects, which are nested inside of the array.
