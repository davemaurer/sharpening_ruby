# The term 'scope' is a concept based on a lot of moving parts, and the way scope is implemented in many languages is
# hard to explain with just one overarching statement. In Ruby, we have 'variable scope'. Ruby also uses 'block scope'.
# Don't try to think of them as different concepts. Just learn how to use scope with different variable types, and by
# creating variables within blocks. Then you can dig into what Ruby scope really is, and maybe write a blog post about it!
