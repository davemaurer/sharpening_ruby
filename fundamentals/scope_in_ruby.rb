# The term 'scope' is a concept, and the way scope is implemented in many languages is hard to explain with just one
# overarching statement. Ruby scope is often called 'variable scope'. Ruby also uses 'block scope'. Don't try to think
# of them as different concepts. Just learn how to use scope different variables, and by creating variables within blocks.
# Then you can dig into what Ruby scope really is, and maybe write a blog post about it!
