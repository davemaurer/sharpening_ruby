To get better at programming, or to start learning it at all, you need to have the right strategy. Some ways of learning
are more effective than others. I will go over the things I think are most important to effective learning.

Make background tasks as easy as possible. Every decision you have to work through drains your mental bucket, so make as
many things as you can automatic:

1. Type fast: This doesn't make or break a programmer, but the easier it is to get the code in the editor, the less time
   and brain power you need to use on that process. Typing.io is great, and just using that 15-20 minutes a day can
   drastically improve your speed.

2. Take good notes. 

3. Know your built in methods backwards and forwards. Map, select, find, reduce, each. All of these should be mindless for
   you. Do them so many times they just happen, without you really needing to struggle through the process, or check a
   reference. We all need to look at an example sometimes, but every time you do, you take your mind off of the next step
   in the chain of things you are trying to make happen. You take you eye off the ball so to speak. Do that as little as
   possible.
